Chromium for Debian
====================

Please read the file /usr/share/bug/chromium-browser/presubj for information
you may want to know if you will report a bug.

DOWNGRADE
-----------------------------

Some people have complained that after downgrading chromium, all tabs
are sad.
Unfortunately, Chromium does not allow downgrading. To avoid this issue
you need to backup your ~/.config/chromium

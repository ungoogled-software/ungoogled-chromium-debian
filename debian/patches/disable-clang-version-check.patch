description: remove strict clang version check during config
author: Andres Salomon <dilinger@debian.org>

Chromium 107 has a strict clang version check, added in commit
8f23a2c2d14fd799813134e995c160354d75d3a0. This needs a proper fix
upstream; some way to check (or specify) whether it's a distribution
build, and therefore shouldn't require a particular git version of
clang.

For now, let's just get this building in debian.

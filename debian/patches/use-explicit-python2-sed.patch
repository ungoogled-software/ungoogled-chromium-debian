Description: use explicit python2
 This patch replaces references to /usr/bin/python and
 env python with /usr/bin/python2 and env python2
 it was created with the following sed commands
 
 for file in `grep -rl '/usr/bin/python' *`; do sed -i 's_/usr/bin/python\b_/usr/bin/python2_' $file ; done
 for file in `grep -rl 'env python' *`; do sed -i 's_env python\b_env python2_' $file ; done

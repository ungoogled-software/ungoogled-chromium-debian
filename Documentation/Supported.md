## Guarantees

-   **Debian Stable** / **Ubuntu LTS** will be supported at<br>
    least until the next of their releases is available.

-   **Ubuntu Regular** release will be supported <br>
    until their upstream **E**nd-**O**f-**L**ife date.

<br>
<br>

## Timing

The actual time we decide to drop support for a <br>
release after the guaranteed windows depends <br>
on what we have to gain.

### Reasons

*for which we may drop a release.*

-   Upgrading to a newer toolchain

-   Reintroduction of system libraries
